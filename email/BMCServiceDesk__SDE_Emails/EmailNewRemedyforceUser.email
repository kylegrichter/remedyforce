                <p>Your Remedyforce access has been created.</p>
                <p>You will be able to access RemedyForce via <a href="https://remedy.my.salesforce.com">https://remedy.my.salesforce.com</a>. This Single-Sign-On link will not require a username or password as long as you are logged into a machine on the company network</p>         
                <p>You have the ability to add yourself to the queues that you will support by doing the following:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Log in and click on the Self Service Tab</li>
                        <li>Select the ‘Common Service Requests’</li>
                        <li>Click on the <a href="https://remedy.my.salesforce.com/apex/bmcservicedesk__ssredirect?type=sr&id=a3YE00000008SJEMA2">‘Queue Management-Add yourself to a Queue’</a></li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>When the form opens, simply select the queue that you need to be a member of, and an approval email will go out to the owner for approval. Once approved, you will be added to that queue.</p>
                <p>IMPORTANT: Once you have been added to a Queue, it is very important that you set up your default queue in RemedyForce. Please go to this link and follow the instructions on how to do that. <a href="https://remedy.my.salesforce.com/apex/BMCServiceDesk__KM_ArticleView?name=KBA129">https://remedy.my.salesforce.com/apex/BMCServiceDesk__KM_ArticleView?name=KBA129</a></p>
